# Groundhog Day
A Twitter bot that tracks when it's Groundhog Day. [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/twitter-%231DA1F2.svg?&logo=twitter&logoColor=white)](https://twitter.com/GroundhogDayy)

Every day, the bot counts how many days remain for the next Groundhog Day and tracks the current season. The bot then tweets the remaining time and a groundhog picture specific for the season. But if it's Groundhog Day, it announces the date and posts a gif of Punxsutawney Phil.

This project was built using the [Tweepy module](https://www.tweepy.org) to interact with the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api).

The initial idea was to use features from the [Jaguar Bot Project](https://github.com/lfvperes/jaguar-bot), written in NodeJS. That idea resulted in [this example](https://github.com/lfvperes/groundhog-day/blob/main/groundhog-countdown.js), used as reference to write the countdown logic in Python. As this project is very simple, not much would be used from the Jaguar Bot; so it was helpful to learn a new module.
